# crouton-init

Setting up a new chroot with crouton can be a pain.

Instead of manually installing and reconfiguring packages, I am aiming to make some scripts that will automate the process.

I'm writing these with myself in mind, but am trying to write them in a way that may be beneficial for others as well.
